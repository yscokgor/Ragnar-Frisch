    "In this project, we delve into the food consumption patterns in Guatemala, aiming to uncover the nutritional landscape of the region. By leveraging detailed household expenditure data, we attempt to quantify the nutritional intake across different demographics. This analysis not only sheds light on the dietary habits of Guatemalans but also sets the stage for a comparative study with Senegal, aiming to understand the nutritional disparities and similarities between these two geographically and culturally distinct countries"
